<h1>NBA Now</h1>

<p> 

NBA NOW is a simple terminal application built with Go. 
The TUI is built using [Charm](https://charm.sh)'s suite of libraries.

Big thanks to [Swar's NBA API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) project's 
extensive documentation of the NBA APIs. This project would not be possible
without it!
